# pong

The goal of this project is to work on a 3D version of this game.   
Only one paddle will be considered, located in the (0xy) plane (which is defined by the equation z = 0).    
The incidence angle should be between 0 and 90 degrees.
Bounces on the paddle and game over will not be taken into account;  
in other words, only the motion of the ball will be considered,   
regardless of the context.
